## EAnalytics Javascript Tracking

EAnalytics is a [Yii Framework](www.yiiframework.com) wrapper for [Analytics.js Library](https://github.com/segment.io/analytics.js). Rather than loading in a dozen different extensions for each analytics service you want to use, this extension allows you to specify various tracking providers in a single config file and call various methods via a single interface.

## Installation
EAnalytics can be installed via ```composer```. Add the following to your ```composer.json``` ```require``` section.

	"charlesportwoodii/eanalytics": "dev-master"

Then run ```composer update```

## Configuring

Clone the repository to your extensions folder and add the following to your config/main.php:

    'preload' => array('EAnalytics'),
    'components' => array(
		'EAnalytics' => array(
			'class' => 'ext.analytics.EAnalytics',
			'lowerBounceRate' => false,
			'providers' => array(
				// List of Providers
			)
		)
	)

The extension must be preloaded if you want analytics.js to load up on page load

#### lowerBounceRate

Some analytics services treat any user who only visits a single page as a "bounce". This setting fires off 3 events 15s, 30s, and 60s after the initial page to load which can help determine if a user only needed to visit your site for a single page or actually bounced.

Setting this value to "true" will eanble this feature. By default it is disabled.

#### providers

This is an array of all the providers that you wish to enable. This array is transformed into JSON and injected into __analytics.initialize()__ on page load.

You may view the list of available providers [at segment.io's integration page](https://segment.io/docs/integrations)
